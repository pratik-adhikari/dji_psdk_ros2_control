# GeoGimbal

GeoGimbal is a ROS 2 package intended to control the gimbal of a UAV, enabling the capture of geo-specific images (For implementation, DJI Matrice 300 and DJI PayloadSDK being used). The project focuses on creating a modular structure that separates system identification & control logic for gimbal (from DJI-specific communication), preferabley to make it adaptable for other UAV platforms equipped with reliable positioning sensors like RTK-GNSS.

(This project assumes the gimbal control a solved problem, and targets to model the system for RTK-GNSS to calculate the instantanious gimbal orientation)

Capturing high-resolution images that are precisely aligned with specific geographic coordinates is crucial for applications such as environmental monitoring, infrastructure inspection, and scientific data collection. GeoGimbal provides a robust solution for controlling a UAV's gimbal and camera to achieve this precision.
